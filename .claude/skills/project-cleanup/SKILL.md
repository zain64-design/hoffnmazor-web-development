name: project-cleanup
description: Remove everything from this Next.js (JS/JSX) landing page project that the single index page does not use: extra pages, unused components and sub-components, unused data files, unused images in public/, and unused CSS in globals.css (via PurgeCSS). Use when asked to clean up, trim or purge the project.

# Project cleanup (single landing page)

## Goal
This project came from a purchased theme with many demo pages and components.
Only ONE page is used: `src/app/(webRoutes)/page.jsx` (the index page). Keep
only what that page actually needs and remove the rest: pages, components,
data files, images and CSS. Design and behavior must stay exactly the same.

## Hard rules
- **NEVER delete these, under any circumstance:** `src/app/not-found.jsx`
  and everything inside `src/app/thank-you/`. They already exist and are
  part of the final site. They must also never be moved, renamed or
  emptied. The same applies to `src/app/api/**`, `src/app/favicon.ico`
  and `src/app/globals.css`. If your plan lists any of these for
  deletion, the plan is wrong. Fix it before showing it to me.
- Nothing is deleted until I approve the plan. Plan first, then wait.
- Work in phases (see below). After each phase: run `npm run build`, fix
  errors, and tell me. Do one git commit per phase (ask me before the first
  commit if the working tree is dirty).
- Use `git rm` for deletions so everything can be restored from git.
- Never touch: `node_modules`, `.next`, `.git`, `package.json` /
  lockfile (only report unused dependencies, do not remove them), config
  files (`next.config.*`, `jsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.*`, `postcss.*`).
- Do not change JSX markup, logic, class names or text of kept files. Only
  imports may change if a path is wrong, and only if something breaks.
- JavaScript/JSX only. Do not add TypeScript. Do not add Tailwind.
- Do not install anything into the project. Tools like PurgeCSS must be run
  through `npx` or from a temporary folder outside the project.
- If you are unsure whether something is used, KEEP it and list it under
  "Uncertain" in the plan for me to decide.

## What is the "kept set"
Start from these entry points and follow imports recursively:
1. `src/app/(webRoutes)/page.jsx` (the index page)
2. The layout chain this page renders inside: `src/app/layout.jsx` (or
   `layout.js`) and `src/app/(webRoutes)/layout.jsx` (header, footer,
   scripts, providers, fonts and CSS imports live here and are needed even
   though they are not in page.jsx)
3. Files I created that ALREADY EXIST and must be kept (they are not
   imported by page.jsx but are used by Next.js or by the form):
   `src/app/not-found.jsx`, `src/app/thank-you/**`, `src/app/api/**`,
   `src/app/favicon.ico`, `src/app/globals.css`, plus `robots` / `sitemap`
   files if present, and EVERYTHING these files import (components,
   images, CSS, data). Treat all of them as entry points, like page.jsx.

Follow every kind of reference: static `import`, `require`, `import()` and
`next/dynamic(() => import(...))`, re-exports from `index.js` files, path
aliases from `jsconfig.json` (e.g. `@/`), CSS imports, and data files
imported by components. A component is kept only if it is reachable from the
kept set. Sub-components inside a kept component's folder follow the same
rule (kept only if actually imported).

Write the reachability check as a small throwaway Node script placed OUTSIDE
`src` (for example in the OS temp folder). Do not leave it in the project.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Pages, components, data
Remove everything not in the kept set:
- Other route folders (e.g. `home2`, `home3`, `(innerpage)`, any demo pages)
  and their `layout`/`page` files
- Unused components and sub-components (e.g. in `_components/`)
- Unused data/helper/hook/util files
- Empty folders left behind
Report any nav/menu links in the kept header/footer that point to removed
pages. Do NOT edit them. Just list them so I can decide.

### Phase 2: Images and other public assets
Find every asset reference in the KEPT files only:
- `src="/..."`, `<Image src=...>`, `srcSet`, `<source>`, `<video poster>`
- static imports of images, `url(...)` in kept CSS, inline `style`
  backgrounds, `backgroundImage` in JSX
- metadata/openGraph/icons/manifest images, favicon
- image paths stored in kept data files
- template strings like `/img/${name}.png`: treat the whole matching folder
  as used and mark it "Uncertain"
Then list every file in `public/` that is an image (png, jpg, jpeg, webp,
avif, svg, gif, ico) with no reference. Delete only those after approval.
Non-image files in `public/` (fonts, scripts, videos, json, pdf) are never
deleted automatically: list them and tell me which ones look unused. Fonts
referenced by CSS and scripts referenced in layouts must stay.

### Phase 3: CSS purge (globals.css)
Goal: `globals.css` should contain only CSS that the kept components use.
1. Find where the theme CSS comes from: `globals.css` (renamed from
   `main.css`), plus any other CSS the layout imports (bootstrap, icon
   fonts, animate, swiper, etc.). Tell me the files and their sizes first.
2. Keep a backup of the current CSS OUTSIDE `src` (e.g. temp folder) and
   rely on the phase 1/2 commits for git history.
3. Run PurgeCSS via `npx` with `content` set to ALL kept `.jsx/.js` files
   (components, layouts, pages, data files). Do not purge against the
   deleted files.
4. Safelist everything added at runtime by JS or libraries, at minimum
   patterns for: `wow`, `animated`, `fadeIn*`, `active`, `show`, `showing`,
   `collapse`, `collapsing`, `fade`, `swiper*`, `slick*`, `iti*`
   (intl-tel-input), `odometer*`, `offcanvas*`, `modal*`, `accordion*`,
   `sticky*`, `header-*`, `scroll*`, `gsap*`, `is-*`, `has-*`, `bi`, `bi-*`
   used by kept files, and any class toggled in kept JS (search for
   `classList`, `className=` with conditions, template strings, GSAP code,
   and `useState`-driven classes). Also keep: `html`, `body`, `:root`
   variables, `@font-face`, `@keyframes` that are used, `@media` rules for
   kept selectors, and vendor prefixes.
5. Do not remove CSS variables (`--...`) that are used anywhere in kept
   CSS or JSX.
6. Show me before/after file sizes and a summary of what was removed. Then
   write the purged result into `globals.css` (keeping its position in the
   import order and the original order of rules).
7. If any CSS import in the layout becomes empty or unused, report it.

### Phase 4: Report only (no changes)
- npm dependencies in `package.json` that no kept file imports (report the
  list only; I will decide)
- Remaining unused files you were unsure about
- ESLint warnings for unused imports/variables in kept files (report only)

## Verification (after every phase and at the end)
- `src/app/not-found.jsx` and `src/app/thank-you/page.jsx` still exist,
  render without errors, and every image, component and CSS rule they use
  is still present. Check this explicitly in your report.
- `npm run build` passes.
- `npm run dev`: the index page loads with no 404s for images, fonts or
  scripts (check the dev server/terminal output and search the code for
  broken paths).
- Search the kept files for any import that points to a deleted path.
- Anything that looks visually different must be reported. If you can,
  take before/after screenshots of the index page (desktop and mobile
  width) with a temporary Playwright script outside the project and
  compare them. If you cannot, tell me what I should check manually:
  header menu, hero, sliders, accordions/FAQ, tabs, counters, animations,
  the contact form (including the phone flag dropdown), and the footer.

## Plan format (show this before any deletion)
1. Kept set summary: number of pages, components, data files
2. Files/folders to delete (grouped, with counts)
3. Images to delete (count, total size) and non-image assets that look unused
4. CSS files involved, current sizes, and the planned safelist
5. "Uncertain" list with your recommendation for each
6. Broken-link warnings (menu links to removed pages)
Then stop and wait for my approval.

## Report back at the end
Counts and sizes before/after (files, `public/` size, CSS size), anything
uncertain that was kept, anything that needs my manual action.
